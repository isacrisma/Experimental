## Setting

This project was designed as a study experiment on the Kenya Agricultural Carbon Project (KACP) intervention. Supported by the World Bank through the NGO Vi Agroforestry, the KACP’s aim is to restore degraded agricultural land to convert into operational ecosystems. To this end, the project promotes the adoption of Sustainable Agricultural Land Management (SALM) techniques across two counties in Kenya: Kisumu and Bungoma.  

In order to promote and implement its sustainable goals, the project relies on field advisors to train registered farmer groups on SALM practices. These advisors are also tasked with monitoring, assessing and evaluating KACP’s activities. Farmers are directly contracted by Vi Agroforestry. In practice, the roll out plan lasts nine years and it ends once more than 90% of all farmers have implemented SALM techniques. Such techniques include the use of residues for mulching and composting, cover crops, water harvesting, terracing and agroforestry to restore soil fertility, improve resilience and remove greenhouse gases through carbon sequestration.

## RCT Design

This field experiment studies households from Kanduyi who haven’t been involved in fodder banking practises. Firstly, they will be divided into two groups, those who have a positive belief about fodder banking as a social norm and those who haven't. Each one of those two sets will be divided into two other groups: a control and a treatment group. The two control groups will receive a message containing neutral information. On the other hand, the two treatment groups will receive a message containing origin-salient information. Finally, a year after the treatment, experimenters will measure the change in the behavior of the farmers. The following figure shows a schematic of the process.

Comparing the changes in the control and its correspondent treatment group will shed light on the question whether there is a causal effect of information about social norms on climate friendly behavior. In addition, comparing the size of the two effects, the effect in the group of farmers who already had a positive belief about fodder banking as a social norm and the effect in the other group, will allow to assess if the effect on the group with a bigger belief updating is, as expected, bigger than the effect on the other group.

## Variables of Interest

The main outcome will be the adoption of agroforestry activities as promoted by the KACP in a constituency within Bungoma County where the project was not carried out. More specifically, the main outcome is defined as whether or not farmers in the treated wards in Kanduyi are engaging in the practice of fodder banking. This technique consists of planting fodder trees (e.g. Calliandra, Sesbania sesban, Gliricidia sepium) as a feed source for livestock. Growing fodder trees has also been found to help meet production shortages in times of extreme climatic conditions, increase crop yield and promote environmental sustainability. 

In order to test the effect of social norms on climate friendly behavior, this experiment builds upon a control and treatment group where information on fodder banking is framed differently. As it was already mentioned, the control and treatment groups division will be carried out for two different groups: those who have a positive belief about fodder banking as a social norm and those who haven't.

More precisely, this study presents two different messages to two different groups. The Control Group receives a message containing neutral information, where the origin of farmers engaged in fodder banking is not revealed. On the other hand, the Treatment Group receives a message containing origin-salient information. In this case, the message reveals the origin of farmers engaged in fodder banking.
